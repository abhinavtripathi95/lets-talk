Hi, I am Abhinav Tripathi. I am an AI enthusiast, and I love to discuss the social impact of technology. I am a "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver" fan, and spend some of my free time learning psychology. I love to read novels, work out and have deep conversations. I also dearly miss playing football due to the ongoing pandemic.
